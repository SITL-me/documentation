  Pandoc is a free and open-source software document converter, widely used
  as a writing tool (especially by scholars)[1][2][3][4] and as a basis for
  publishing workflows.[5][6][7] It was originally created by John Mac-
  Farlane, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

  **Supported file formats**

  Pandoc's most thoroughly supported file format is an extended version of
  Markdown, but it can also read many other forms of lightweight markup
  language, HTML, ReStructuredText, LaTeX, OPML, Org-mode, DocBook, and
  Office Open XML (Microsoft Word .docx).

  It can be used to create files in many more formats, including Office
  Open XML, OpenDocument, HTML, Wiki markup, InDesign ICML, web-based
  slideshows, ebooks, OPML, and various TeX formats (through which it can
  produce a PDF). It has built-in support for converting LaTeX mathematical
  equations to MathML and MathJax, among other formats.

  Plug-ins for custom formats can also be written in Lua, which has been
  used to create an exporting tool for the Journal Article Tag Suite.

  LizardFS uses pandoc to generate manpages out of the source of the
  documentation which is written in restructured text.
