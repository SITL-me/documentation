NAME
====

lizardfs gettrashtime, lizardfs settrashtime, lizardfs rgettrashtime, lizardfs rsettrashtime - get or set trash time

SYNOPSIS
========

::

 lizardfs gettrashtime [-r] [-n|-h|-H] 'OBJECT'...
 lizardfs rgettrashtime* [-n|-h|-H] 'OBJECT'...
 lizardfs settrashtime* [-r] [-n|-h|-H] SECONDS[+|-] 'OBJECT'...
 lizardfs rsettrashtime* [-n|-h|-H] SECONDS[+|-] 'OBJECT'...

DESCRIPTION
===========

**gettrashtime** and **settrashtime** operate on an object's 'trashtime'
value, i.e. the number of seconds the file is preserved in the special 'trash'
directory before it's finally removed from the filesystem. 'Trashtime' must be
a non-negative integer value. *gettrashtime* prints the current 'trashtime'
value of given object(s).

OPTIONS
=======

-r
  This option enables recursive mode, which works as usual for every given
  file, but for every given directory additionally prints the current
  'trashtime' value of all contained objects (files and directories).
-n, -h, -H
  These options are described in lizardfs(1).

N[+|-]
  If a new value is specified in 'N'+ form, the 'trashtime' value is increased
  to 'N' for objects with lower 'trashtime' value and unchanged for the rest.
  Similarly, if a new value is specified as 'N'-, the 'trashtime' value is
  decreased to 'N' for objects with higher 'trashtime' value and unchanged for
  the rest. These tools can be used on any file, directory or deleted
  ('trash') file.


.. note:: *rgettrashtime* and *rsettrashtime* are deprecated aliases for
   *gettrashtime -r* and *settrashtime -r* respectively.
