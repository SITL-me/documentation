NAME
====

lizardfs makesnapshot - make lazy copies

SYNOPSIS
========

::

  lizardfs makesnapshot [-o] [-f] [-i] [-s <VALUE>] 'SOURCE'... 'DESTINATION'

DESCRIPTION
===========

**makesnapshot** makes a "real" snapshot (lazy copy, like in case of
*appendchunks*) of some object(s) or a subtree (similarly to the *cp -r*
command). It's atomic in respect to each 'SOURCE' argument separately. If
'DESTINATION' points to an already existing file, an error will be reported
unless *-f* (force) or it's alias *-o* (overwrite) option is given.

The new object exists only in metadata until changes to the data are done
which will trigger creation of chunks for the changed files or removing
metadata entries for erased chunks, unless the trash feature is utilized.

NOTE: if 'SOURCE' is a directory, it's copied as a whole; but if it's followed
by a trailing slash, only the directory content is copied.

OPTIONS
=======

-s <value>
  This option is used to specify the number of nodes that will be atomically
  cloned.
-i
  ignore missing source nodes in snapshot request

REPORTING BUGS
==============
