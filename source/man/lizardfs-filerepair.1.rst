NAME
====

lizardfs filerepair - repair broken files

SYNOPSIS
========

::

  lizardfs filerepair [-n|-h|-H] 'FILE'...

DESCRIPTION
===========

**filerepair** deals with broken files (those which cause I/O errors on read
operations) to make them partially readable. In case of a missing chunk it
fills the missing parts of the file with zeros; in case of a chunk version
mismatch it sets the chunk version known to *mfsmaster* to the highest one
found on the chunkservers.

.. note:: Because in the second case content mismatch can occur in chunks with
   the same version, it is advised to make a copy (not a snapshot!)
   and delete the original file after "repairing".

OPTIONS
=======

-c
  This option enables correct-only mode, which will restore chunk to a
  previous version if possible, but will never erase any data.


-n, -h, -H
  These options are described in lizardfs(1).
