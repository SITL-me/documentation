.. auth-status-proof1/none

Welcome to the documenters-project for lizardfs. This pages shall introduce you
to our Tools and Workflows.

Documentation is written in reStructuredText
(http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), then we build the different Formats
(html, pdf) with the Help of sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html).

If you want to generate nroff man pages as well, you will also need to install
pandoc (http://pandoc.org/).


Editorial Workflow
==================

.. auth-status-proof1/none

To ease the authoring-process and to uphold the quality of our documentation
every section goes through at least the following stages:

#. **todo** (this section needs a helping hand)
#. **writing** (somebody is writing content, others: please don't interfere)
#. **proof1** (proofreading stage 1, somebody with appropriate knowledge
   checks the written content for correctness regarding facts and
   understandability)
#. **proof2** (proofreading stage 2, somebody - preferably a native speaker -
   checks the content for grammar, spelling etc. No content/fact-changes here,
   if necessary set state back to proof1 and add a todo-remark)
#. **frozen** (this section is done, find another one to work on, there is
   plenty of work available :)

While authoring the status of a section can go forth and back, writing is not
a oneway-road...

The implementation of those stages is done with the comment-directive of rst.
Put a line below the section-title like::

  .. auth-status-todo/none
  .. auth-status-writing/<my-own-email>
  .. auth-status-proof1/<my-own-email>
  .. auth-status-proof2/<my-own-email>
  .. auth-status-frozen/none

the part after the "/" indicates *who* is working on the respective section.
If you just finished a stage and want to indicate the next stage is to be done
by "somebody", use "none" instead of an email-address.

All in all a section-start should look like::


  Section-Title
  =============

  .. auth-status-writing/wolfram@example.com

.. note:: This mechanism is meant to make our lives easier, *please* don't
   use it for commanding others! The only one who is entitled to put an
   email-address in a authoring-tag is the person owning that address. It is
   used to indicate "i take responsibility for that section". Misusing
   mechanisms for command-like "you take responsibility" actions will
   definitely kill our motivation.



ToDo notes
==========

.. auth-status-proof1/none

These notes can be used anywhere in the documentation as anonymous reminders.
It is a good idea to also note keywords for content to be written as todo note
when they come to your mind. ToDo notes have the syntax::

  .. todo:: explain something

  .. todo::
     explain something complex
     * explain part 1
     * explain part 2
     * explain part 3

ToDo notes go to the documentation in the place where they are written and to
the ToDo-List (you need to "make clean" to generate a new ToDo-List).
It is easy to generate documentation while leaving todo-notes
out. To do that find the line::

  todo_include_todos = True

in conf.py of the documentation-directory and change its value to "False"
before generating the docs.

Styleguide / Organizing Files
=============================

.. auth-status-proof1/none

Headers are taken from the Python documentation project::

  Parts:            ############## (with over line)

  Chapters:         ************** (with over line)

  Sections:         ===========

  Subsections:      -----------

  Subsubsections:   ^^^^^^^^^^^

  Paragraphs:	     """"""""""


* Table of Content (ToC) depth: 2 Levels (Also 2 levels in every Part except
  for the glossary)
* Subdirectories are for separate manuals that should be build able standalone.
* The manual pages should be build able as man pages standalone.
* Add .. code-block:: <lang> to literal blocks so that they get highlighted.
  Prefer relying on automatic highlighting simply using :: (two colons). This
  has the benefit that if the code contains some invalid syntax, it won’t be
  highlighted. Adding .. code-block:: python, for example, will force
  highlighting despite invalid syntax.
* In section titles, capitalize only initial words and proper nouns.
* Wrap the documentation at 80 characters wide, unless a code example is
  significantly less readable when split over two lines, or for another good
  reason.


Writing style
=============

.. auth-status-proof1/none

When using pronouns in reference to a hypothetical person, such as “a user
with a session cookie”, gender neutral pronouns (they/their/them) should be
used. Instead of::

  he or she... use they.
  him or her... use them.
  his or her... use their.
  his or hers... use theirs.
  himself or herself... use themselves.


Installing the documenters Tools on different Platforms
=======================================================


debian8 (jessie)
----------------

.. auth-status-writing/wolfram@lizardfs.com

The best way to get the documentation formatting-tools up and running is:

First:

 * apt-get install pandoc pandoc-data

Than (the sphinx in the Debian repo is too old) :

 * choose a place for your virtual environment for sphinx
 * setup a virtual environment for sphinx::

   $ virtualenv sphinx

 * activate your virtual python environment::

   $ source sphinx/bin/acticate

 * install the newest sphinx and tools::

   $ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild


This should be enough to build the html-documentation.
If you want pdf as well you will need texlive/pdflatex - caution, that one is
really a *large* set of software.


Mac/OS X
--------
.. auth-status-todo/none

If you are following our :ref:`workspace_mac` recommendations and use
:ref:`homebrew` the installation of the tools required to compile manpages is
pretty simple. Just issue::

  brew install pandoc

and you are all set up. To compile the documentation some additional work has
to be done.

To install sphinx correctly on MacOS/X you will need to make use of a virtual
python environment::

 * choose a place for your virtual environment for sphinx
 * setup a virtual environment for sphinx::

   $ virtualenv sphinx

 * activate your virtual python environment::

   $ source sphinx/bin/acticate

 * install the newest sphinx and tools::

   $ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild

.. todo:: add instructions for virtualenv and sphinx.



FreeBSD
-------

For building the manpages and documentation you will require the following
packages::

  hs-pandoc
  hs-pandoc-types
  py27-sphinx-1.4.4

FreeBSD keeps its sphinx pretty actual so there should be no problem in
building the docs.

Build-Process
=============

.. auth-status-proof1/none

Before you can build something you will need to get the lizardfs sources.
Read :ref:`get_and_install_from_source` whilst ignoring the stuff about cmake.
When you pulled the sources from github look for a subdirectory named
"docs", this is where the current documentation lives - everything happens
here,

There is a Makefile in the repo for building documentation. It is derived from
the one generated by sphinx-quickstart.

To build the html-documentation in one huge html-file (plus images)::

  make singlehtml

To build the html-documentation splitted up to different files::

  make html

To build the pdf-documentation::

  make latexpdf

If things go wrong when building the documentation, first check if all the
tools for your selected target-format are available on your system (check
terminal-output for "command not found"-messages)


Submitting your work
====================
.. auth-status-proof1/none

.. auth-status-proof1/none

Read :ref:`submitting_patches` for information about our conventions. In short
this means for us:

* First line of the commit-message is preceded by "doc: ", The first character
  of the remaining line has to be uppercase. First line is of form::

    doc: Short-description max-length 65 characters

* After the first line of the commit-message add a blank-line
* third part of the commit-message is a longer description with lines of 80
  characters maximum-length.

A complete commit-message looks like the following::

  doc: Fixed references to other documentation

  The refs to adminguide/basic_configuration and to filesystem/georeplication
  had a wrong syntax.
