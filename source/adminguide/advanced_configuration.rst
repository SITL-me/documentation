.. _chunk_load_awareness:

Configuring chunk server load awareness
=======================================

In a default setup the system will try to distribute all chunks evenly
according to the predefined goals and/or ec configurations. This is also what
happens to chunk servers in a defined label group (check here :ref:`
labeling_chunk server` for labels). While this is the perfect setting for most
cases, other case might require a different setting, for example if your chunk
servers are doing other non LizardFS related workloads, you will want to have
the distribution be based also on the amount of I/O load each chunk server is
handling at a given moment.

This functionality can be achieved by setting the ::

  ENABLE_LOAD_FACTOR

setting in the chunk server's mfschunkserver.cfg configuration file. By default
this is disabled and the setting is a per chunk server setting.

Additionally it is possible to define a **penalty** configuration option in the
master configuration file (The setting for this is **LOAD_FACTOR_PENALTY**),
if tit is found to be under heavy I/O load.

.. _rack_awareness:

Configuring rack awareness (network topology)
=============================================

The topology of a LizardFS network can be defined in the mfstopology.cfg file.
This configuration file consists of lines matching the following syntax::

   ADDRESS SWITCH-NUMBER

ADDRESS can be represented as:

+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  \*               | all addresses                                         |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  n.n.n.n          | single IP address                                     |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  n.n.n.n/b        | IP class specified by network address and bits number |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  n.n.n.n/m.m.m.m  | IP class specified by network address and mask        |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  f.f.f.f-t.t.t.t  | IP range specified by from-to addresses (inclusive)   |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

The switch number can be specified as a positive 32-bit integer.

Distances calculated from mfstopology.cfg are used to sort chunk servers during
read/write operations. Chunk servers closer (with lower distance) to a client
will be favored over further away ones.

Please note that new chunks are still created at random to ensure their equal
distribution. Re balancing procedures ignore topology configuration as well.

As for now, distance between switches can be set to 0, 1, 2:

  0 - IP addresses are the same

  1 - IP addresses differ, but switch numbers are the same

  2 - switch numbers differ

The topology feature works well with chunk server labeling - a combination of
the two can be used to make sure that clients read to/write from chunk servers
best suited for them (e.g. from the same network switch).


.. _lizardfs_qos:

Configuring QoS
===============

Quality of service can be configured in the /etc/mfs/globaliolimits.cfg file.

Configuration options consist of:

* subsystem <subsystem>
  cgroups subsystem by which clients are classified
* limit <group> <throughput in KiB/s>
* limit for clients in cgroup <group>
* limit unclassified <throughput in KiB/s>
* limit for clients that do not match to any specified group.

If globaliolimits.cfg is not empty and this option is not set, not specifying
limit unclassified will prevent unclassified clients from performing I/O on
LizardFS

Example 1::

    # All client share 1MiB/s bandwidth
    limit unclassified 1024

Example 2::

    # All clients in blkio/a group are limited to 1MiB/s, other clients are blocked
    subsystem blkio
    limit /a 1024

Example 3::

   # The directory /a in the blkio group is allowed to transfer 1MiB/s
   # /b/a group gets 2MiB/s
   # unclassified  clients share 256KiB/s of bandwidth.
        subsystem blkio
       	limit unclassified 256
       	limit /a   1024
       	limit /b/a 2048

.. _lizardfs_quotas:

Configuring Quotas
==================

Quota mechanism can be used to limit inodes usage and space usage for users
and groups. By default quotas can be set only by a superuser. Setting the
SESFLAG_ALLCANCHANGEQUOTA flag in the mfsexports.cfg file would allow
everybody to change quota.

In order to set quota for a certain user/group you can simply use mfssetquota
tool::

   mfssetquota  (-u UID/-g GID)   SL_SIZE   HL_SIZE   SL_INODES   HL_INODES   MOUNTPOINT_PATH

where:

* SL - soft limit
* HL - hard limit

.. _mount_meta:

Mounting the meta data
======================

LizardFS meta data can be managed through a special mount point called META.
This mount point allows to control trashed items (undelete/delete them
permanently) and view files that are already deleted but still held open by
clients.

To be able to mount meta data you need to add the “mfsmeta” parameter to the
mfsmount command::

   # mfsmount /mnt/lizardfs-meta -o mfsmeta

after that you will see the following line at mtab::

   mfsmeta#10.32.20.41:9321 on /mnt/lizardfs-meta type fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other)

The structure of the mounted meta data directory will look like this::

   /mnt/lizardfs-meta/
                      ├── reserved
                      └── trash
                      └── undel

.. _meta_trash:

Trash directory
---------------

Each file with a 'trashtime' setting above zero will be present here. You
can recover those files or delete them permanently.

Recovering files from the trash
-------------------------------

In order to recover a file, just must move it to the undel/ directory. Files
are represented by their inode number and path, so the file dir1/dir2/file.txt
with inode 5 will be present at::

   trash/5|dir1|dir2|file.txt,

and recovering it would be performed like this::

   $ cd trash
   $ mv ‘5|dir1|dir2|file.txt’ undel/


Removing files permanently
--------------------------

In order to delete a file permanently, just remove it from trash.

Reserved directory
------------------

If you delete a file, but someone else uses this file and keeps an open
descriptor, you will see this file in here until the descriptor is closed.

.. _lizardfs_ha_cluster:

Deploying LizardFS as a HA Cluster
==================================

LizardFS can be run as a high-availability cluster on several nodes. When
working in HA mode, a dedicated daemon watches the status of the meta data
servers and performs a fail over whenever it detects a master server has
crashed (e.g. due to a power outage). The state of the available participating
servers is being constantly monitored via a lightweight protocol doing a
'heartbeat' like check on the other nodes. Running a LizardFS installation as
a HA-cluster significantly increases its availability. Since uRaft uses
:ref:`quorum` a reasonable minimum of meta data servers in a HA installation
is at least 3, to make sure that a proper election with a 'majority' of voices
can be done. For details on the underlying algorithm, check :ref:`raft` in the
glossary.

In order to deploy LizardFS as a high-availability cluster, follow the steps
below.

These steps should be performed on all machines chosen to be in a cluster.

Install the lizardfs-uraft package::

   $ apt-get install lizardfs-uraft for Debian/Ubuntu
   $ yum install lizardfs-uraft for CentOS/RedHat

Prepare your installation:

Fill lizardfs-master config file (/etc/mfs/mfsmaster.cfg) according to
:ref:`master_server_config`. Details depend on your personal configuration,
the only fields essential for uraft are::

   PERSONALITY = ha-cluster-managed
   ADMIN_PASSWORD = your-lizardfs-password
   MASTER_HOST = the floating ip so that the participating hosts know where to sync the meta database from

For a fresh installation, execute the standard steps for the lizardfs-master
(creating mfsexports file, empty meta data file etc.). Do not start the
lizardfs-master daemon yet.

Fill the lizardfs-uraft config file (/etc/mfs/lizardfs-uraft.cfg). Configurable
fields are:

**URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS**
  identifiers of all the machines in your cluster
**URAFT_ID**
  node address ordinal number; should be unique for each machine
**URAFT_FLOATING_IP**
  IP at which LizardFS will be accessible for the clients
**URAFT_FLOATING_NETMASK**
  a matching netmask for floating IP
**URAFT_FLOATING_IFACE**
  network interface for the floating IP
**URAFT_ELECTOR_MODE**
  ...
**LOCAL_MASTER_ADDRESS**
  The address of the local master controlled by this uraft node, defaults to
  localhost.
**LOCAL_MASTER_MATOCL_PORT**
  The port the local master listens on, defaults to 9421
**ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MIN**
  Minimum election timeout (ms), defaults to 400
**ELECTION_TIMEOUT_MAX**
  Maximum election timeout (ms), defaults to 600
**HEARTBEAT_PERIOD** = 20
  Period between heartbeat messages between uraft nodes (ms), defaults to 20.
**LOCAL_MASTER_CHECK_PERIOD**
  How often uRaft checks if local master is alive (ms), defaults to 250.


Example configuration for a cluster with 3 machines:
----------------------------------------------------

The first, node1, is at 192.168.0.1, the second node gets hostname node2, and
the third one gets hostname node3 and operates under a non-default port number
- 99427.

All machines are inside a network with a 255.255.255.0 netmask and use
their network interface eth1 for the floating ip.

The LizardFS installation will be accessible at 192.168.0.100 ::

   # Configuration for node1:
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = 192.168.0.1            # ip of first node
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = node2                  # hostname of second node
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = node3:99427            # hostname and custom port of third node
   URAFT_ID = 0                                # URAFT_ID for this node
   URAFT_FLOATING_IP = 192.168.0.100           # Shared (floating) ip address for this cluster
   URAFT_FLOATING_NETMASK = 255.255.255.0      # Netmask for the floating ip
   URAFT_FLOATING_IFACE = eth1                 # Network interface for the floating ip on this node

  # Configuration for node2:
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = 192.168.0.1            # ip of first node
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = node2                  # hostname of second node
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = node3:99427            # hostname and custom port of third node
   URAFT_ID = 1                                # URAFT_ID for this node
   URAFT_FLOATING_IP = 192.168.0.100           # Shared (floating) ip address for this cluster
   URAFT_FLOATING_NETMASK = 255.255.255.0      # Netmask for the floating ip
   URAFT_FLOATING_IFACE = eth1                 # Network interface for the floating ip on this node

   # Configuration for node3:
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = 192.168.0.1            # ip of first node
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = node2                  # hostname of second node
   URAFT_NODE_ADDRESS = node3:99427            # hostname and custom port of third node
   URAFT_ID = 2                                # URAFT_ID for this node
   URAFT_FLOATING_IP = 192.168.0.100           # Shared (floating) ip address for this cluster
   URAFT_FLOATING_NETMASK = 255.255.255.0      # Netmask for the floating ip
   URAFT_FLOATING_IFACE = eth1                 # Network interface for the floating ip on this node

Enable arp broadcasting in your system (for the floating IP to work)::

	$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_accept

Start the lizardfs-uraft service:

Change “false” to “true” in /etc/default/lizardfs-uraft::

   $ service lizardfs-uraft start

You can check your uraft status via telnet on URAFT_STATUS_PORT
(default: 9428)::

	$ telnet NODE-ADDRESS 9428

When running telnet locally on a node, it is sufficient to use::

	$ telnet localhost 9428

Please check if you have the :ref:`sudo` package installed and that the 'mfs'
user has been added with the right permissions to the /etc/sudoers file.
